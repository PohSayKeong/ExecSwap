Hackathon Developer Experience Feedback

1. The documentation was quite complete and easy to navigate overall.

2. The team was very responsive and helpful in addressing issues — really appreciated the quick support when I encountered problems.

3. I faced an issue where my platform couldn’t deploy my iApp to Arbitrum Sepolia, but I managed to get help and resolve it with the team’s assistance.

4. The iapp mock command could be improved by offering a wider selection of data types. Initially, I thought that protected data didn’t support arrays of strings, which caused some confusion.

5. The documentation can feel a bit overwhelming at first since there are multiple sections (Get Started, Guides, References, Protocol, etc.). It might help to streamline or guide new users through a more linear flow.

6. I didn’t realize that RLC was required to run iApps until much later on. It would be great to have a full end-to-end tutorial that walks through the entire process, not just up to protecting data.
